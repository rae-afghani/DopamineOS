Howdy!

I wanted to take the time to outline my plan for this app. I broke it down into 3 phases, each of which builds upon the last.

PHASE ONE: CORE PRODUCT (MVP)
Goal: A fully-functional daily hub. Works entirely offline.

*IA & Navigation 
-Today (home)
-Plan (tasks)
-Track (health, wealth, self)
-Journal
-Me (profile/settings)

Key Screens & Flows

-Today (Home)
>Header: greeting, date, tiny 'streak counter'
>Daily Boot Up: short checklist (generated actions vary on time of day), mark all action
>Focus 3: show only top 3 tasks for today (add/reorder/complete)
>Quick Add: input to add a task, journal line, spend, (choose type via segmented control)
>Mini Trackers: mood picker (emojis), energy tracker,
>Button Row: Primary (start focus), Secondary (Plan day)

-Plan (tasks)
>Inbox, today, upcoming, (3 chips, top)
>task card: title, due, priority, checkbox
>add task: title (req), due date (opt), priority tag (low, md, high)
>bulk actions: complete/mark all, move to tomorrow

-Track (health, wealth, self)
>emoji mood entry
>money spent, invested, saved
>hobbies, habits

-Journal
>quick entry
>entries list (date/first line)

-Me (profile/settings)
>theme: dark/light/system
>haptics and reminders: on/off
>data: export json, clear local data
>about

*UX Guardrails
-One obvious CTA per screen
-limit visible tasks to 3
-gentle micro-rewards
-zero-config onboarding (low energy)


EXPECTED COMPLETION DATE: 9/10/2025

PHASE THREE:
